IPv6 Essentials

Well, I was doing my usual thing teaching IPv6 and I was informed that GitHub had a great IPv6 repository, so ofcourse I went.
I thought to myself there are probably dozens of these all around the hub, and I did not want to go down a worm hole.
Nonetheless, I looked, and - yes it was good, but it was not great, and I instantly wanted to make it better.

So I made a note to myself to create a really good IPv6 essentials repository of stuff and links and much more.

Well, here it is.

Hope you like it and find it helpful.  

If you think something is missing, let me know.
